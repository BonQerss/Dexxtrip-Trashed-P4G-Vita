  <description>This mod removes the random element of studying so you're guaranteed to receive the "dictionary entries..." message and bonus point every time.

It DOES NOT affect the point you receive for having read "Expert Study Methods". You still need to read that book to get that particular bonus point.

Enjoy this mod? Let me know! https://ko-fi.com/rudiger</description>
