  <description>A standalone portion of P4GEX.

Makes Orange Smash and TaP Soda stock in Shopping District South separate and increased to 9 per week.

Removes the RNG component from the machine in District North, but limits the stock to 15 (Total) to compensate.

Adds a "Buy Everything" option to both machines which empties out the remaining available stock.</description>
