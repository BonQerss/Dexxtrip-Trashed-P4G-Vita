  <description>You don't want to keep pressing main menu and use healing skills? You don't have healing skills to heal HP? 

This mod is for you. This is a Quality of Life mod that will auto heal your HP to full as long as you have enough SP.

SP Formula if you are interested:

HPtoHeal = ((TotalHP-CurrentHP)/ 2 * 0.35) + 6 
SPlost= CurrentSP-HPtoHeal

In case if SP is not enough to full heal:

SPlost = CurrentHP + ( CurrentSP * 4 );

Just for Yukiko's Dungeon (Since it is very early game and may not have enough SP item to get), the following formula is:

HPtoHeal = (TotalHP-CurrentHP)/ 2 * 0.25 
SPlost= CurrentSP-HPtoHeal

In case if SP is not enough to full heal:

SPlost = CurrentHP + ( CurrentSP * 4 );

Note: This mod also blocks the Half SP Cut in Hollow Forest, making the penalty every after battle not punishing.</description>
